# dedit
dedit is a discord bot that takes C code compiles it, and sends it back to you :p

(may not be online majority of the time lol, much more reliable to just run yourself)

SETTINGS is a file that should be included along with the main.py when running the format should be as follows:
```
token: <token here>
```
File requests should be as follows:
```
-n <name>
-p <platform: must be 'windows' or 'linux'>
-f <flags>
```C
<code here>
\```
```
(i cannot seem to get md to behave correctly omit that '\\' that is on the last line)

to run yourself gcc and mingw64 must be installed
